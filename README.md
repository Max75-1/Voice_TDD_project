With this little project I start the bigger Autocaller ( Haigan ) project.

In this stage ( Voice project ) I'm vorking on Nucleo-L152RE evaluation board and SIM808 GSM/GPRS shield module producted by Elecrow. 
In this project I'm record little voice message and translate it in headphones. In addition, I has added a button and two LED's. The button is pressing six times.
In first time LED_1 set on. In second time LED_1 is toggle and voice is record in microphone of headphones. In third time recording is stopped and LED_1 is set off.
In four time LED_2 is set on. In five time the record is played in headphones and LED_2 is toggle. In six time LED_2 is set off and playing of record is stopped 
and deleted.

In addition, in this project I'm use FreeRTOS technology for working in real time with all tasks, and TDD ( Test Driven Development ) for test my code, 
writted in Embedded C.

I hope, my project is working into your Nucleo-L152RE board and SIM808 shield :-)
